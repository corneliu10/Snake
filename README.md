# Snake

### A implementation of the classic game Snake. The person who wants to
play the game can choose two game modes, relax mode where you play freely, without
obstacles or other things; adventure mode where you have to pass progressive difficulty levels,
avoid obstacles(walls), gather points(fruits) and an original work, I came with the idea to
implement portals to get from side to side passing through these portals.

### Installing

You need to install Visual C++, then run Snake/bin/Debug/Snake.exe
